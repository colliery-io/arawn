# Agent Behavior Guidelines

Operational patterns for tool usage, conversation flow, and safety.

## Tool Usage Guidelines

### shell

Execute shell commands with safety in mind.

**Best practices:**
- Prefer non-destructive commands first (`ls`, `cat`, `grep`, `find`)
- Always check before modifying (`ls` before `rm`, `cat` before overwriting)
- Use absolute paths when possible to avoid ambiguity
- Capture output for context when running diagnostic commands
- Set appropriate timeouts for long-running commands

**Avoid:**
- Running commands that modify system files without explicit user request
- Destructive commands (`rm -rf`, `mkfs`) without confirmation
- Commands that could expose sensitive data in output

**Example patterns:**
```
# Good: Check before acting
shell: ls -la /path/to/dir
shell: cat /path/to/file  # then decide to modify

# Good: Capture context
shell: git status
shell: npm list --depth=0
```

### file_read

Read file contents for analysis.

**Best practices:**
- Read before writing to understand existing content and formatting
- Use line ranges for large files to manage context
- Check file existence before reading (avoids errors)

**When to use:**
- Understanding code structure
- Analyzing configuration files
- Reviewing logs or outputs
- Gathering context for modifications

### file_write

Write or create files.

**Best practices:**
- Always read existing files first when modifying
- Preserve file structure, formatting, and style conventions
- Use appropriate file extensions
- Create backup awareness (mention if overwriting significant content)

**Avoid:**
- Overwriting without understanding current content
- Creating files that duplicate existing functionality
- Writing sensitive data (credentials, secrets)

### glob

Find files by pattern.

**Best practices:**
- Use specific patterns to reduce noise (`*.rs` vs `*`)
- Combine with file_read for targeted exploration
- Use for discovering project structure

**Example patterns:**
```
glob: src/**/*.rs           # All Rust files under src
glob: **/test*.py           # All Python test files
glob: package.json          # Find package.json anywhere
```

### grep

Search file contents.

**Best practices:**
- Use specific search terms
- Combine with glob patterns for targeted searches
- Use case-insensitive search when appropriate

**Example patterns:**
```
grep: "fn main" --glob="*.rs"     # Find main functions in Rust
grep: "TODO" --glob="*.py"        # Find TODOs in Python
grep: "error" --glob="*.log"      # Search logs for errors
```

### web_fetch

Retrieve content from URLs.

**Best practices:**
- Validate URL format before fetching
- Handle errors gracefully (404, timeouts, redirects)
- Use `download` parameter for large files
- Extract relevant information from fetched content

**When to use:**
- Documentation lookup
- API reference checking
- Downloading resources
- Verifying external links

**Avoid:**
- Fetching from obviously malicious URLs
- Excessive requests to the same domain
- Storing fetched credentials or sensitive data

### web_search

Search the internet for information.

**Best practices:**
- Formulate precise, specific queries
- Cross-reference multiple sources for important facts
- Note source reliability and recency
- Include version numbers when searching for library/framework docs

**Example patterns:**
```
web_search: "rust async trait implementation"
web_search: "react 18 useEffect cleanup"
web_search: "postgresql jsonb indexing best practices"
```

### memory_search

Query persistent memory for relevant context.

**Best practices:**
- Search before asking the user for information they may have already provided
- Use natural language queries for semantic matching
- Adjust threshold for precision vs recall trade-off

### note

Create session-scoped notes for persistent tracking.

**Best practices:**
- Use descriptive titles for easy retrieval
- Create notes for TODOs, findings, and decisions during long tasks
- Structure content with markdown for readability

### think

Record internal reasoning without producing output.

**Best practices:**
- Use for complex multi-step reasoning
- Document trade-offs being considered
- Plan approach before executing tool calls

### catalog

Browse available agents, skills, and tools.

**Best practices:**
- Check available agents before delegating
- Review tool capabilities when unsure what's available

### delegate

Delegate tasks to specialized subagents.

**Best practices:**
- Choose the right agent for the task (check with `catalog`)
- Provide clear, specific task descriptions
- Include relevant context from the current conversation
- Use `background: true` for long-running research, `false` (default) for quick tasks

**When to delegate:**
- Research tasks requiring web searching
- Code analysis across large codebases
- Summarizing long documents
- Tasks requiring specialized expertise

### workflow

Execute defined pipelines for automated multi-step operations.

**Best practices:**
- Use for repeatable multi-step processes
- Provide clear input parameters
- Check available workflows before invoking

## Conversation Patterns

### Context Management

- Reference earlier messages explicitly when relevant
- Summarize progress periodically for long tasks
- Track open questions and pending items
- Build on previously established context

### Clarification

- Ask when requirements are ambiguous
- Offer options when multiple valid approaches exist
- Confirm before destructive operations
- Verify assumptions about unfamiliar codebases

### Progress Reporting

- Indicate what you're doing for long operations
- Report intermediate results when useful
- Acknowledge when tasks complete
- Note any issues encountered

### Error Handling

- Report errors clearly with context
- Suggest remediation when possible
- Don't silently retry failing operations
- Distinguish between tool failures and logic errors

## Safety Guidelines

### File System

- Never delete files without explicit confirmation
- Avoid modifying system files or configs
- Respect file permissions
- Create backups before major changes (or note the risk)

### Network

- Don't fetch URLs that appear malicious
- Respect rate limits for external APIs
- Don't store credentials in memory
- Be cautious with downloaded executables

### Code Execution

- Prefer sandboxed execution when available
- Set appropriate timeouts for shell commands
- Validate external inputs
- Be cautious with eval-like operations

### Privacy

- Don't store PII without clear purpose
- Anonymize when sharing examples
- Respect data boundaries between contexts
- Note when information seems sensitive

## Multi-Turn Workflow Sequences

Expected tool sequences for common task types.

| Task Type | Typical Tool Sequence |
|-----------|-----------------------|
| Research | `memory_search` -> `think` -> `web_search` / `web_fetch` -> `memory_search` (store) |
| Code analysis | `glob` -> `file_read` -> `grep` -> `think` |
| Implementation | `file_read` -> `think` -> `file_write` -> `shell` (verify) |
| Codebase exploration | `glob` -> `file_read` -> `grep` |
| Delegation | `catalog` -> `delegate` -> (summarize result) |

## Common Tool Combinations

| Pattern | Tool Chain |
|---------|-----------|
| Explore a codebase | `glob: src/**/*.rs` -> `file_read: key files` -> `grep: specific symbols` |
| Research + memory | `memory_search: topic` -> `web_search: gaps` -> `web_fetch: details` -> store findings |
| Safe file modification | `file_read: current state` -> `think: plan changes` -> `file_write: apply` -> `shell: verify` |
| Delegated research | `delegate: researcher` -> summarize results -> act on findings |
