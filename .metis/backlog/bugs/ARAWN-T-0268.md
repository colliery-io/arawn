# Startup errors logged to stderr without timestamps

## Objective

Startup errors from `arawn start` are written to stderr via `anyhow`'s default `Display` — bare text with no timestamps, no log level, no structure. This makes it impossible to distinguish old errors from new ones when inspecting `launchd-stderr.log`, since the same line repeats with no temporal context.

## Bug Details

### Type
- [x] Bug - Production issue that needs fixing

### Priority
- [ ] P1 - High (important for user experience)

### Impact Assessment
- **Affected Users**: All users running arawn as a launchd/systemd service
- **Reproduction Steps**: 
  1. Start arawn with a missing API key (or any startup error condition)
  2. Fix the issue and restart
  3. Check `~/.config/arawn/logs/launchd-stderr.log`
  4. Old errors and new errors are indistinguishable — no timestamps
- **Expected vs Actual**: Errors should be timestamped and structured (like stdout logs via `tracing`). Instead they are bare `Error: <message>` lines.

### Root Cause

`crates/arawn/src/commands/start.rs` returns `anyhow::Result` from `run()`. When this errors, clap/main prints it to stderr as plain text. The tracing subscriber is configured for stdout only. Stderr gets raw `eprintln!`/`anyhow` output with no formatting.

## Acceptance Criteria

## Acceptance Criteria

## Acceptance Criteria

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Startup errors are logged with timestamps and log level (ERROR) matching the tracing format used on stdout
- [ ] `launchd-stderr.log` entries have timestamps so old vs new errors can be distinguished
- [ ] Existing stdout tracing output is unaffected

## Implementation Notes

### Technical Approach
Route fatal startup errors through the `tracing` infrastructure (`tracing::error!`) before exiting, or configure the tracing subscriber to also write to stderr for ERROR level. Alternatively, ensure the main entrypoint catches errors and logs them via tracing before printing to stderr.

### Key Files
- `crates/arawn/src/commands/start.rs` — startup error path
- `crates/arawn/src/main.rs` — top-level error handling

## Status Updates

### Fix Applied

**`main.rs`**: Added `tracing::error!` call before the `eprintln!` fallback in the top-level error handler. This ensures fatal errors are logged to the rotating log file with timestamps, log level, and target — matching the format of all other tracing output.

**`start.rs`**: Converted all 46 `eprintln!("warning: ...")` and `eprintln!("error: ...")` calls to `tracing::warn!()` / `tracing::error!()`. These were non-fatal startup warnings (failed to load backends, missing configs, fallback paths, etc.) that previously went to stderr as bare text. Now they go through the tracing infrastructure with timestamps, appearing in both the console and the rotating JSON log file.

**Result**: All startup output now has timestamps. `launchd-stderr.log` will still receive the `eprintln!` fallback from `main()` for fatal errors, but the same error also appears in the structured `arawn.log` with full temporal context.
