//! Filesystem access gate for sandboxed tool execution.
//!
//! Defines the [`FsGate`] trait that enforces workstream-scoped filesystem
//! boundaries. The trait is defined here in `arawn-types` so both `arawn-agent`
//! (consumer) and `arawn-workstream` (implementor) can reference it without
//! circular dependencies.
